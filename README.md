## Impact

NASA produces a variety of surface solar and meteorological data parameters that are useful to commercial renewable energy and sustainable building ventures, but this information is not easily accessible to the typical homeowner. Now users can easily get a graphical overview of available sunshine in any particular place and they can make any future decisions without any doubt.
